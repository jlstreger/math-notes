    <h1>About the Tutor</h1>
    <p>My name is Jennifer Streger and I am a proud graduate from the <strong>Texas A&M University</strong> Class of 2018. Whoop! I have both a <strong>Masters and Bachelors in Mathematics</strong> with a Minor in STEM Education.</p>
    <p>I am currently happily married and living in The Woodlands, TX with my husband. This past year, I have been a teacher with the Academy of Science and Technology teaching both AP Calculus BC and AP Statitics. I have decided to leave this position in order to pursue my dream to work in web development and create my own resources to support students in learning mathematics. I have seen the need for a reliable and easy to use resource for learning mathematics online. </p>
    <p>While I am excited to start this new development, I would also like the opportunity to continue working with students and teaching mathematics. My favorite way to teach is in a one on one tutoring setting where I can get to know the individual student and meet their unique needs.</p>
    <p>I began tutoring while I was a Senior in high school teaching from Pre-Algebra through Calculus. I continued tutoring other students in college. I have also worked as a teaching assistant for Calculus classes in the Texas A&M Mathematics Department. I greatly enjoy working with students and sharing with them my love and appreciation for mathematics.</p>
    <p>I look forward to working with your child to help them not only improve in mathematics but to find a little bit more joy in the subject!</p>
